### Background
Learned C and Turbo Pascal at the age of 12, pursued a double degree in Mathematics and Engineering, and worked in assistant positions in the algebra and logic departments. I dedicated 7+ years to research engineering, specializing in large scale graph optimization dynamics.

In 2019, I co-founded a B2B startup as the CTO to streamline air traffic management tools. I bootstrapped the initial product and build the engineering team. I thrived in the high-intensity and dynamic environment. The experience further developed my technical skills and leadership abilities in software engineering.

- **Programming languages**: TypeScript, Go and Rust.
- **70% frontend**: React, Web Components (Lit) and Web Assembly.
- **20% backend**: REST, WebSockets, UDP/TCP Sockets and GraphQL.
- **10%** data structures and algorithms, 2D/3D engines using WebGPU and wgpu.
- **English** (full professional proficiency) and **Spanish** (native).
