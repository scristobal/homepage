## Summary
In 2010, I graduated in a double degree in Mathematics and Engineering with majors in Algebraic Geometry and Logic. Afterwards, I worked 4 more semesters at the universities of Madrid and Vienna as an associate.

From 2012 until 2019, I worked as a Research Engineer (promoted to senior in 2013 and director in 2017.) in a private research institute located in Madrid, our projects were funded by the EC in the fields of Data Mining, Graph Theory and network optimization. 

In 2019, I moved to Innsbruck, co-founded DataBeacon and assumed the role of Software Engineer and CTO. DataBeacon is a B2B platform that provides Air Traffic Control as a service (ATCaaS) in countries with high air traffic growth. 

The last 3+ years, I have been building DataBeacon’s technology and team. The company serves a small group of early adopters with applications and services in production and demos. The team has grown to around ~20 employees.

However, I am a very technical, hands-on individual. Therefore the prospects of being a CTO of a mid-size company are not aligned with my interests. It is time for me to move on and find new challenges.

## Interests:
- Performant web applications: Rust, Web Assembly and Web Components.
- Graphics: rasterized and ray tracing 3D engines  
- Languages, grammars, parsers and tokenizers
- Pixel art and 8 bit

## Skills
**Programming languages**: TypeScript, Go and Rust. Previously: Python, Scala and C.
**Frontend**: React, Web Components  and Web Assembly.
**Backend**: REST APIs, Web Sockets and GraphQL.
**Languages**: English (IELTS 8.0, July 2021), Spanish and basic German.
