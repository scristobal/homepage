### Background

Learned C and Turbo Pascal at the age of 12, pursued a double degree in Mathematics and Engineering, and worked in assistant positions in the algebra and logic departments. I dedicated 7+ years to research engineering, specializing in large scale graph optimization dynamics.

In 2019, I co-founded a B2B startup as the CTO to streamline air traffic management tools. I bootstrapped the initial product and build the engineering team. I thrived in the high-intensity and dynamic environment. The experience further developed my technical skills and leadership abilities in software engineering.
