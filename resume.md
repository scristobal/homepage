## Summary
In 2019, I co-founded DataBeacon and assumed the role of CTO. Since then, I have been working as a full-stack Software Engineer, writing mostly TypeScript, React, Go and Node.
The company has grown to around ~20 employees, so it is time for me to move on and find new challenges possibly as an IC.
Previously, I worked 7+ years as a Research Engineer, in data mining and network optimization with Python and C. I have a MSc. + BSc. with honours in Mathematics -majored in algebraic geometry and logic- and B.Eng. in Telecommunication systems, best record award 2005.
