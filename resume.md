## Summary
I graduated in Mathematics with major in Algebraic Geometry and Logic in 2010 and stayed two more terms at the universities of Madrid and Vienna as associate.

From 2012 until 2019, I worked as a Research Engineer (promoted to senior in 2013 and director in 2017.) in a private research institute located in Madrid, our projects were funded by the EC in the fields of Data Mining, Graph Theory and network optimization. 

In 2019, I moved to Innsbruck, co-founded DataBeacon and assumed the role of Software Engineer and CTO. DataBeacon is a B2B platform that provides Air Traffic Control as a service, ATCaaS.

The last 3+ years, I have been building DataBeacon’s technology and team. The company serves a small group of early adopters, has two applications and multiple services in production, and has grown to around ~20 employees.

I am a very technical, hands-on individual. Therefore the prospects of being a CTO of a mid-size company are not aligned with my interests. It is time for me to move on and find new challenges.
