## Summary
In 2010, I graduated in Mathematics with major in Algebraic Geometry and Logic and spent two years doing theoretical research at international universities. Afterwards, I got into Data Mining and Network Optimization, worked 7+ years as a Research Engineer in a private research institute on internatinal projects. 
In 2019, I co-founded DataBeacon and assumed the role of CTO and Software Engineer. The last 3+ years, I have built DataBeacon’s technology and team. 
Today, the company has grown to around ~20 employees, and I am not interested in a pure managerial role, so it is time for me to move on and find new challenges.
