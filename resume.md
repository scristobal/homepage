## Summary
In 2010, I graduated in Mathematics with major in Algebraic Geometry and Logic and spent two years doing academic research at international universities. Afterwards, I worked in data mining and network optimization during 7+ years as a Research Engineer. In 2019, I co-founded DataBeacon and assumed the role of CTO and Software Engineer. 
Last 3+ years, I built DataBeacon’s technology and team. Today, the company has grown to around ~20 employees, and I am not interested in a pure managerial role, so it is time for me to move on and find new challenges.
